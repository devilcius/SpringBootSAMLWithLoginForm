# Spring Boot Sample SAML 2.0 Service Provider and Form Login
====================
## Project description

This project is a sample implementation of a **SAML 2.0 Service Provider**, completely built on **Spring Framework**. 
It combines two types of authentication: through SAML or a database backed form login.


**SSOCircle** ([ssocircle.com](http://www.ssocircle.com/en/portfolio/publicidp/)) is used as public Identity Provider for test purpose.


Inspired in *Vincenzo de Notaris' project* ([github.com/vdenotaris/spring-boot-security-saml-sample))work.

### References

#### Spring Boot

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss.  It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

#### Spring Security SAML Extension

> Spring SAML Extension allows seamless inclusion of SAML 2.0 Service Provider capabilities in Spring applications. All products supporting SAML 2.0 in Identity Provider mode (e.g. ADFS 2.0, Shibboleth, OpenAM/OpenSSO, Ping Federate, Okta) can be used to connect with Spring SAML Extension.
